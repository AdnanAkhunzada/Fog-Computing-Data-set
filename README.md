# Fog-Computing-Data-set
This is IoT tuples/jobs information, ranging from 20K to 100K, this data set can be used in large scale computing environments such as Fog/Edge/Cloud computing etc. The dataset contains TupleName, TupleId, Size of the Tuple (Size of a job), MIPS (Million Instruction per Second), Total processors, RAM size, Bandwidth, Geo-location (Coordinates), DataType (contains Abrupt, smalltextual, medical and sensors etc), Data Percentage, IsReversed (not served by Fog or Cloud), IsServerd (boolean, It is served or not), and IsserverbyCloud,  DeviceType (Sensors, Dumobjects, Mobiles, Acuator and LocationBased, etc), QueueDelay (how much time it will stay in queue), InternalProcessingTime, QueueWait, Temperature etc.
